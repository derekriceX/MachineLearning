## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# transformation - normalizing numeric data 

normalize <- function (x){
  return ((x-min(x))/(max(x)-min(x)))
  }

```


```{r}
setwd("D:/Dropbox/13 - R-WD/MachineLearning/MachineLearning")
wbcd <- read.csv("wisc_bc_data.csv",header=TRUE)
head(wbcd)
str(wbcd)
```

```{r}
wbcd <- wbcd[-1] # remove 1st column from the dataset 
table(wbcd$diagnosis) # diagnosis is the target outcome B=357 vs M=212 instances 
str(wbcd$diagnosis) # currently a chr - need target to be a factor 
wbcd$diagnosis <- factor(wbcd$diagnosis, levels =c("B","M"),labels = c("Benign","Malignant"))
str(wbcd$diagnosis) # Factor w/ 2 levels "Benign","Malignant": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 ...
prop.table(table(wbcd$diagnosis)) #returns decimal fraction to eight decimal places
round(prop.table(table(wbcd$diagnosis))*100,digits=1) # Benighn = 62.7 and Malignant = 37.3
summary(wbcd) # 30 features all numeric three different measurements of 10 char 

# all 30 features are on different scales

normalize(c(1,2,3,4,5)) # function seems to be working 
normalize(c(10,20,30,40,50)) # get the same normalized vaues 

# the lapply() function takes a list and applies a specified function to each list element 
# a data frame is a list of equal length vectors, we can use lapply() to apply normalize() to exach feature in the data frame 
# the final step is to convert the list return by lapply() to a data frame using the as.data.frame() function 

wbcd_n <- as.data.frame(lapply(wbcd[2:31],normalize))
head(wbcd_n)

```
```{r}
summary(wbcd_n)

## step 2
## data preparation - creating training and test datasets 

wbcd_train <- wbcd_n[1:469,]
wbcd_test <- wbcd_n[470:569,]
wbcd_train_labels <- wbcd[1:469,1]
wbcd_test_labels <- wbcd[470:569,1]
```

Step 3 - training a KNN model on the data 
# uses library(class) - provides a basic R functions for classification
# The knn() function in the class package provides a standard, traditional implementation of the k-NN algorithm
# for each instance in the test data, the function will identify the k nearest neighbors using elclidean distance where k is a user-specifed number 

# kNN classification syntex
# using the knn() function in the class package
# building the classifer and making predictions:
## p <- knn(train,test,class,k)
### train - is a data frame containing numberic training data
### test - is a data frame containing numeric test data
### class is a factor vector with class for each row in the training data
### k is an integer indicating the number of nearest neighbors 
# the function returns a factor vector of predicted classes for each row in the test data frame 


```{r}
# Step 3 - training a kNN model
library(class)
wbcd_pred <- knn(train = wbcd_train,test=wbcd_test,cl=wbcd_train_labels,k=3)

```

Step 4 - evaluating model performance
